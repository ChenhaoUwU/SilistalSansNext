<pre>--- Rationale ---

There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.

If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font
Bakery could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure
call (rpc).

There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Checks that the family name infered from the font filename matches the string
at nameID 1 (NAMEID_FONT_FAMILY_NAME) if it conforms to RIBBI and otherwise
checks that nameID 1 is the family name + the style name.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Entry [FONT_FAMILY_NAME(1):WINDOWS(3)] on the "name" table: Expected "Mplus Latin 50" but got "MplusCode50". [code: mismatch]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See
googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues/329

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWinAscent & usWinDescent.</summary>

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

* [com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking correctness of monospaced metadata.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE
definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen
variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font
mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the
font is monospaced.&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan
  monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2

* OS/2.xAvgCharWidth must be set accurately.
  &quot;OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by
Windows GDI&quot;
  http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:
Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave
a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual
advance widths and treat it as monospaced. Source:
https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/45140/#Comment_45140


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** On monospaced fonts, the value of post.isFixedPitch must be set to a non-zero value (meaning 'fixed width monospaced'), but got 0 instead. [code: mono-bad-post-isFixedPitch]
* 🔥 **FAIL** On monospaced fonts, the value of OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (proportion: monospaced), but got 0 instead. [code: mono-bad-panose-proportion]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class should be non-spacing.
Spacing glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class may have incorrect anchor
positioning that was only intended for building composite glyphs during design.


</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class become non-spacing and may be repositioned
if they have mark anchors.
Only combining mark glyphs should be in that class. Any non-mark glyph must not
be in that class, in particular spacing glyphs.


</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test looks for consecutive line segments which have the same angle. This
normally happens if an outline point has been added by accident.

This test is not run for variable fonts, as they may legitimately have colinear
vectors.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following glyphs have colinear vectors:
	* colonmonetary.BRACKET.234: L<<236.0,139.0>--<260.0,365.0>> -> L<<260.0,365.0>--<286.0,614.0>> and colonmonetary.BRACKET.234: L<<384.0,460.0>--<374.0,365.0>> -> L<<374.0,365.0>--<348.0,118.0>> [code: found-colinear-vectors]

<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test heuristically detects outline segments which form a particularly
small angle, indicative of an outline error. This may cause false positives in
cases such as extreme ink traps, so should be regarded as advisory and backed
up by manual inspection.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following glyphs have jaggy segments:

<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test detects line segments which are nearly, but not quite, exactly
horizontal or vertical. Sometimes such lines are created by design, but often
they are indicative of a design error.

This test is disabled for italic styles, which often contain nearly-upright
lines.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.

This test looks for consecutive line segments which have the same angle. This

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE

  &quot;OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by

<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE
definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen
variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font
mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the
font is monospaced.&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan
  monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2

* OS/2.xAvgCharWidth must be set accurately.
  &quot;OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by
Windows GDI&quot;
  http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:
Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave
a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See
googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues/329

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

* [com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE
definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen
variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font
mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the
font is monospaced.&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan
  monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2

* OS/2.xAvgCharWidth must be set accurately.
  &quot;OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by
Windows GDI&quot;
  http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:
Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave
a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual
advance widths and treat it as monospaced. Source:
https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/45140/#Comment_45140

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions

rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the

<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE
definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen
variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font
mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the
font is monospaced.&quot;

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:

a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

This test is not run for variable fonts, as they may legitimately have colinear

<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See
googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues/329

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE
definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen
variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font
mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the
font is monospaced.&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan
  monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2

* OS/2.xAvgCharWidth must be set accurately.
  &quot;OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by
Windows GDI&quot;
  http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:
Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave
a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

* [com.google.fonts/check/monospace](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/name.html#com.google.fonts/check/monospace)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is
monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced
metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)

Requirements for monospace fonts:

* post.isFixedPitch - &quot;Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero
if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm

* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph&#x27;s width value is
greater.
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm

* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace). Spec says: &quot;The PANOSE
definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen
variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font
mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the
font is monospaced.&quot;
  www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan
  monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2

* OS/2.xAvgCharWidth must be set accurately.
  &quot;OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by
Windows GDI&quot;
  http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:
Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave
a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual
advance widths and treat it as monospaced. Source:

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.

Please also note:
Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave
a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual
advance widths and treat it as monospaced. Source:

* 🔥 **FAIL** On monospaced fonts, the value of post.isFixedPitch must be set to a non-zero value (meaning 'fixed width monospaced'), but got 0 instead. [code: mono-bad-post-isFixedPitch]
* 🔥 **FAIL** On monospaced fonts, the value of OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (proportion: monospaced), but got 0 instead. [code: mono-bad-panose-proportion]
* ⚠ **WARN** Font is monospaced but 1 glyphs (0.17%) have a different width. You should check the widths of: ['m_p_l_u_s_f_o_n_t_s'] [code: mono-outliers]

Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class should be non-spacing.
Spacing glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class may have incorrect anchor
positioning that was only intended for building composite glyphs during design.

Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class become non-spacing and may be repositioned
if they have mark anchors.
Only combining mark glyphs should be in that class. Any non-mark glyph must not
be in that class, in particular spacing glyphs.
